# Deep Learning Demo

## Mnist
Tensorflow-based demo for recognition of hand-written digits. Training is performed on the MNIST dataset.
The demo is based on static graph construction.

`mnist/mnist_slim.ipynb` -> Build, train and test the model


## Mnist Eager
Tensorflow-based demo for recognition of hand-written digits. Training is performed on the MNIST dataset.
The demo is based on TensorFlow Eager Executeion (TF >= 1.7)

`mnist_eager/mnist_eager.ipynb` -> Build, train and test the model

## Cat-Dog
Tensorflow-based demo for binary image classification [Cat | Dog]. Training is performed on the ImageNet subset.
The demo is based on static graph construction.

`Tensorflow_train_model.ipynb` -> Build and train the model

`Tensorflow_freeze_graph.ipynb` -> Freeze Tensorflow graph (prepare for the inference)

`Tensorflow_inference.ipynb` -> Inference
